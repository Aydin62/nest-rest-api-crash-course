<h1>Important</h1>
There was actually a minor issue with the tutorial that was causing the following error at the final minutes of the course:

<h6><em>Nest can't resolve dependencies of the ItemsService (?). Please make sure that the argument at index [0] is available in the AppModule context.</em></h6>

Now, I would like to acknowledge and express my sincere thanks to 
<a href="https://github.com/DanielFryy/NestJS-Crash-Course-TraversyMediaTutorial">Daniel Freire</a> (@DanielFryy) who had successfully resolved the issue before, and I, just like 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56870498/nest-cant-resolve-dependencies-of-the-itemsservice-please-make-sure-that-t">many others</a> throughtout the world, benefited from his guidance.

<p>Please refer to his page in order to fully grasp the issue.</p>
